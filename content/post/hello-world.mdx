# Hello, world!

Ta-da, here's my new blog! I finally reached a point where I was satisfied with the final product. The entire thing was coded from scratch since I dislike templates.

I built this blog using NextJS, a React framework. I'm using it with markdown to generate static Pages. In other words, it's pretty fast.

## Here are some noteworthy features:

- Integration of a comment system powered by GitHub discussions (giscus)
- Full MDX support for blog posts, offering flexibility and rich content like this one
- Compatibility with clients that don't support JavaScript (except for giscus)
- Callouts
- Auto generated opengraph images
- Dark mode ðŸ˜Ž

Curious about the inner workings? You can peek under the hood over on [GitHub](https://github.com/Paranoia8972/blog)!

So, what's on the horizon?
Expect plenty of tech-related content here, with a particular focus on security. This might include write-ups on upcoming events and more. If time permits, I aim to share posts on a biweekly/monthly basis. Stay tuned â€” I've got some exciting topics in the pipeline!
